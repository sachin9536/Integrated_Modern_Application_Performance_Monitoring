# AppVital Monitoring Platform ‚Äì Client Onboarding Guide

Welcome to **AppVital** ‚Äì your all-in-one Application Performance Monitoring (APM) platform! This guide will help you quickly integrate any of your services (in any language or environment) for real-time monitoring, analytics, and insights.

---

## üöÄ Quick Start: Two Modes

### **Production Mode (for Clients)**

- **Purpose:** Monitor your own services in any environment.
- **How to run:**
  ```sh
  docker compose up
  ```
- **What happens:** Only the monitoring platform (backend, Prometheus, frontend) runs. You register your own services via the dashboard.
- **What you see:**
  - If no services are registered, the dashboard will show "No data yet" states.
  - As soon as you register a service (with a `/metrics` endpoint), AppVital will start monitoring it.

### **Demo Mode (for Testing/Sales/Development)**

- **Purpose:** See the platform in action with sample data, even if you have no real services yet.
- **How to run:**
  ```sh
  docker compose --profile demo up
  ```
- **What happens:**
  - The platform runs **plus** sample services (`service_alpha`, `service_beta`, `service_gamma`, `dummy_service`, `service_delta`) and a traffic generator.
  - These demo services expose `/metrics` endpoints and generate realistic traffic and logs.
- **How to use:**
  1. Go to the dashboard at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
  2. Register the demo services using their URLs (see below) in the "Register New Application" form.
     - Example URLs:
       - `http://service_alpha:8000`
       - `http://service_beta:8000`
       - `http://service_gamma:8000`
       - `http://dummy_service:9000`
       - `http://service_delta:9400`
  3. The traffic generator will automatically generate logs and metrics for these services.

## üõ†Ô∏è Instrumenting Your Own Services (Production)

1. **Add Prometheus client library to your service** (any language):
   - [Python](https://github.com/prometheus/client_python)
   - [Node.js](https://github.com/siimon/prom-client)
   - [Go](https://github.com/prometheus/client_golang)
   - [Java](https://github.com/prometheus/client_java)
   - [.NET](https://github.com/prometheus-net/prometheus-net)
2. **Expose a `/metrics` endpoint** in your service.
3. **Register your service** in the AppVital dashboard (name + URL).
4. **AppVital will automatically start monitoring and visualizing your metrics!**

## üßë‚Äçüíª Best Practices & Troubleshooting

- **No data?**
  - Make sure your service is running and `/metrics` is reachable from the monitoring platform.
  - Check that you registered the correct URL (including port).
- **Not using Docker?**
  - Your services do **not** need to run in Docker. Only the monitoring platform does.
- **Want to see sample data?**
  - Use demo mode as described above.
- **Need help instrumenting your service?**
  - See the [Prometheus docs](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/clientlibs/) or contact support.

## üí° Summary

- **Production:** Only the platform runs; you register your own services.
- **Demo:** Platform + sample services + traffic generator for instant demo data.
- **No Docker required for your services!**
